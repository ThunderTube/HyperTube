# ThunderTube

We did our Hypertube project using Vue.js, TailwindCSS, Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB.
Everything can be launched using Docker ðŸŽ‰.

## Requirements

To start the project make sure Docker is correctly installed on your machine.

At the root of the project you can interact with the scripts in the `package.json` file.

## Development mode

To start the project on development mode run :

`docker-compose -f common.yml -f development.yml up`

## Production mode

To start the projet on production mode run :

`docker-compose -f common.yml -f production.yml up`

## Database seeding

The database seeding is automatically performed by `mongo-seed` service.

This service is started after `mongo` one has been launched, reads `db.json` file which contains more than 14K films and insert all of them into the database.
